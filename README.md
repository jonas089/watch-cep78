# Casper-CEP78 NFT supply-chain project
A supply chain project built upon the Casper-CEP78 NFT standard with requirements for authenticity certificates in mind.
### Core functionality:
1. Create a Collection / Product row
2. Mint a Product from within that Collection
3. Track the owner of the product
4. Allow transfers ( owner_mode = 2 )

### Optional functionality:
1. approve operators for transfers
2. burn a product when "destroyed" or "consumed"
